        Firstly I inserted players in Skiplist having IDs from 1 to number of players
and setting their points to 0. I read out of input file and checked if the line
was "print" or a sequence of numbers representing players' time until i get to the end of input file. Then i checked
how many players have their time different of 0, meaning they took part in the
race.
    Then I sorted players by their time and immediately after by their last
rankings so if 2 or more players had the same time, I can still add points the
right way. I added points by the rule specified in the homework details.
    Finally, each player's points became equal to how many they got in that race
added to his last number of points. Search function finds me points of a specified
player. Then I deleted the player from the list and updated it by adding the same
player having the new points number. In the end i called "getLast" function to update and to keep tracking of their rankings.
